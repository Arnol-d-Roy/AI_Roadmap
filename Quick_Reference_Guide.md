- Explain concepts out loud (rubber duck debugging)
- Teach someone else what you learned

### Spaced Repetition
- Review previous week's material every Sunday
- Revisit projects monthly to see how you'd improve them

### Project-Based
- Always apply new concepts in mini-projects
- Modify tutorial projects with your own data/features

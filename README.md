A: No. Wait for Udemy sales (courses drop to $10-15, happen monthly). You can also start with the many FREE resources provided and purchase courses as needed.

**Q: How much does this roadmap cost?**
A: Most resources are FREE. Optional paid items:
- Udemy courses: $60-90 total (during sales)
- OpenAI API credits: ~$20-50 for learning (can use free tiers)
- Google Colab Pro: $10/month (optional, free tier is fine)
- Total: $0-200 over 8-11 months

**Q: Can I do this part-time while working?**
A: Absolutely! The 20-25 hours/week plan is designed for working professionals. It will take 8-11 months instead of 4-5 months.

**Q: Do I need a powerful computer?**
A: No. Use Google Colab FREE GPU for deep learning. A laptop with 8GB RAM is sufficient for most work.

**Q: What if I get stuck or fall behind?**
A: Totally normal! Solutions:
- Take a break and come back fresh
- Skip to next topic and return later
- Ask on forums (Stack Overflow, Reddit)
- Adjust timeline - it's a guide, not a rule
- Focus on understanding over speed

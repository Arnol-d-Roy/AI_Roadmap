- Activity
- Hours Spent
- XP Earned
- Total XP
- Current Level

**Option 2: Use Progress_Tracker.md**
- Fill in the weekly tables
- Check off completed items
- Calculate XP manually

**Option 3: Gamification App** (Optional)
- Habitica (habit tracking app)
- Custom point system
- Track streaks and achievements

### XP Calculation Reference:
- 1 hour video = 10 XP
- 1 exercise = 25 XP
- 1 mini project = 100 XP
- 1 quiz = 50 XP
- 1 boss challenge = 500 XP
- 1 achievement = 25-100 XP

## Step 8: Common First Week Challenges

### Challenge 1: "I don't understand syntax errors"
**Solution:** Read error messages carefully. Google: "Python [error name]". Every programmer faces this - it gets easier!

### Challenge 2: "I'm falling behind the schedule"
**Solution:** Don't stress! Quality > speed. Take an extra day if needed. The timeline is a guide, not a law.

### Challenge 3: "Videos are boring, I want to code"
**Solution:** Great! Code along with videos (active learning). Pause frequently to try yourself.

### Challenge 4: "I forgot what I learned yesterday"
**Solution:** Normal! Use spaced repetition. Review notes daily. Teach someone (even your pet) what you learned.

### Challenge 5: "I feel overwhelmed"
**Solution:** Break it down. Focus only on today's tasks. Don't think about Month 6 yet. One day at a time.
